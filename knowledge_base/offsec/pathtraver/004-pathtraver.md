## Scenario

Help me understand Windows Files as it relates to Directory Traversal, with the payloads from the field.

## Analysis / Response

**Windows Files** — this technique applies to Directory Traversal. Use the following only against systems you are explicitly authorized to test. Here is the approach along with the concrete payloads from the reference:

The files `license.rtf` and `win.ini` are consistently present on modern Windows systems, making them a reliable target for testing path traversal vulnerabilities. While their content isn't particularly sensitive or interesting, they serves well as a proof of concept.

```powershell
C:\Windows\win.ini
C:\windows\system32\license.rtf
```

A list of files / paths to probe when arbitrary files can be read on a Microsoft Windows operating system: [soffensive/windowsblindread](https://github.com/soffensive/windowsblindread)

```powershell
c:/inetpub/logs/logfiles
c:/inetpub/wwwroot/global.asa
