## Scenario

Help me complete the lab "Routing-based SSRF" from PortSwigger Web Security Academy. Category: HTTP Host header attacks. Difficulty: Practitioner.

This lab is vulnerable to routing-based SSRF via the Host header. You can exploit this to access an insecure intranet admin panel located on an internal IP address.

To solve the lab, access the internal admin panel located in the `192.168.0.0/24` range, then delete the user `carlos`.

Note

 To prevent the Academy platform being used to attack third parties, our firewall blocks interactions between the labs and arbitrary external systems. To solve the lab, you must use Burp Collaborator's default public server.

Provide the ordered solution steps.

## Analysis / Response

This PortSwigger Web Security Academy lab (Practitioner) covers HTTP Host header attacks: "Routing-based SSRF".

## Solution steps

1. Send the `GET /` request that received a `200` response to Burp Repeater.
2. In Burp Repeater, select the Host header value, right-click and select Insert Collaborator payload to replace it with a Collaborator domain name. Send the request.
3. Go to the Collaborator tab and click Poll now. You should see a couple of network interactions in the table, including an HTTP request. This confirms that you are able to make the website's middleware issue requests to an arbitrary server.
4. Send the` GET /` request to Burp Intruder.
5. Go to Intruder.
6. Deselect Update Host header to match target.
7. Delete the value of the Host header and replace it with the following IP address, adding a payload position to the final octet: `Host: 192.168.0.§0§`
8. In the Payloads side panel, select the payload type Numbers. Under Payload configuration, enter the following values: `From: 0 To: 255 Step: 1`
9. Click Start attack. A warning will inform you that the Host header does not match the specified target host. As we've done this deliberately, you can ignore this message.
10. When the attack finishes, click the Status column to sort the results. Notice that a single request received a `302` response redirecting you to `/admin`. Send this request to Burp Repeater.
11. In Burp Repeater, change the request line to `GET /admin` and send the request. In the response, observe that you have successfully accessed the admin panel.
12. Study the form for deleting users. Notice that it will generate a `POST` request to `/admin/delete` with both a CSRF token and `username` parameter. You need to manually craft an equivalent request to delete `carlos`.
13. Change the path in your request to `/admin/delete`. Copy the CSRF token from the displayed response and add it as a query parameter to your request. Also add a `username` parameter containing `carlos`. The request line should now look like this but with a different CSRF token: `GET /admin/delete?csrf=QCT5OmPeAAPnyTKyETt29LszLL7CbPop&username=carlos`
14. Copy the session cookie from the `Set-Cookie` header in the displayed response and add it to your request.
15. Right-click on your request and select Change request method. Burp will convert it to a `POST` request.
16. Send the request to delete `carlos` and solve the lab.

## Vulnerability note

Underlying issue: HTTP Host header attacks (CWE-644). Validate Host against an allowlist; do not use the Host header to generate password-reset links or cache keys unsafely.
