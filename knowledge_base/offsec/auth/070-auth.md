- cwe: CWE-287

## Scenario

Help me complete the lab "Username enumeration via account lock" from PortSwigger Web Security Academy. Category: Authentication. Difficulty: Practitioner.

This lab is vulnerable to username enumeration. It uses account locking, but this contains a logic flaw. To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password, then access their account page.

Candidate usernames
Candidate passwords

Provide the ordered solution steps.

## Analysis / Response

This PortSwigger Web Security Academy lab (Practitioner) covers Authentication: "Username enumeration via account lock".

## Solution steps

1. With Burp running, investigate the login page and submit an invalid username and password. Send the `POST /login` request to Burp Intruder.
2. Select Cluster bomb attack from the attack type drop-down menu. Add a payload position to the `username` parameter. Add a blank payload position to the end of the request body by clicking Add §. The result should look something like this: `username=§invalid-username§&password=example§§`
3. In the Payloads side panel, add the list of usernames for the first payload position. For the second payload position, select the Null payloads type and choose the option to generate 5 payloads. This will effectively cause each username to be repeated 5 times. Start the attack.
4. In the results, notice that the responses for one of the usernames were longer than responses when using other usernames. Study the response more closely and notice that it contains a different error message: `You have made too many incorrect login attempts.` Make a note of this username.
5. Create a new Burp Intruder attack on the `POST /login` request, but this time select Sniper attack from the attack type drop-down menu. Set the `username` parameter to the username that you just identified and add a payload position to the `password` parameter.
6. Add the list of passwords to the payload set and create a grep extraction rule for the error message. Start the attack.
7. In the results, look at the grep extract column. Notice that there are a couple of different error messages, but one of the responses did not contain any error message. Make a note of this password.
8. Wait for a minute to allow the account lock to reset. Log in using the username and password that you identified and access the user account page to solve the lab.

## Vulnerability note

Underlying issue: Authentication (CWE-287). Use proven auth libraries, rate-limit and lock out brute force, protect password reset flows, and store credentials with strong hashing.
