## Scenario

How do I solve this PortSwigger Web Security Academy lab?

Title: Web cache poisoning via HTTP/2 request tunnelling
Difficulty: Expert
Category: HTTP request smuggling

This lab is vulnerable to request smuggling because the front-end server downgrades HTTP/2 requests and doesn't consistently sanitize incoming headers.

To solve the lab, poison the cache in such a way that when the victim visits the home page, their browser executes `alert(1)`. A victim user will visit the home page every 15 seconds.

The front-end server doesn't reuse the connection to the back-end, so isn't vulnerable to classic request smuggling attacks. However, it is still vulnerable to request tunnelling.

## Analysis / Response

This PortSwigger Web Security Academy lab (Expert) covers HTTP request smuggling: "Web cache poisoning via HTTP/2 request tunnelling".

## Solution steps

1. Send a request for `GET /` to Burp Repeater. Expand the Inspector's Request Attributes section and make sure the protocol is set to HTTP/2.
2. Using the Inspector, try smuggling an arbitrary header in the `:path` pseudo-header, making sure to preserve a valid request line for the downgraded request as follows: Name `:path` Value `/?cachebuster=1 HTTP/1.1\r\n Foo: bar` Observe that you still receive a normal response, confirming that you're able to inject via the `:path`.
3. Change the request method to `HEAD` and use the `:path` pseudo-header to tunnel a request for another arbitrary endpoint as follows: Name `:path` Value `/?cachebuster=2 HTTP/1.1\r\n Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net\r\n\r\n GET /post?postId=1 HTTP/1.1\r\n Foo: bar` Note that we've ensured that the main request is valid by including a `Host` header before the split. We've also left an arbitrary trailing header to capture the `HTTP/1.1` suffix that will be appended to the request line by the front-end during rewriting.
4. Send the request and observe that you are able to view the tunnelled response. If you can't, try using a different `postId`.
5. Remove everything except the path and cachebuster query parameter from the `:path` pseudo-header and resend the request. Observe that you have successfully poisoned the cache with the tunnelled response.
6. Now you need to find a gadget that reflects an HTML-based XSS payload without encoding or escaping it. Send a response for `GET /resources` and observe that this triggers a redirect to `/resources/`.
7. Try tunnelling this request via the `:path` pseudo-header, including an XSS payload in the query string as follows. Name `:path` Value `/?cachebuster=3 HTTP/1.1\r\n Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net\r\n\r\n GET /resources?<script>alert(1)</script> HTTP/1.1\r\n Foo: bar` Observe that the request times out. This is because the `Content-Length` header in the main response is longer than the nested response to your tunnelled request.
8. From the proxy history, check the `Content-Length` in the response to a normal `GET /` request and make a note of its value. Go back to your malicious request in Burp Repeater and add enough arbitrary characters after the closing `</script>` tag to pad your reflected payload so that the length of the tunnelled response will exceed the `Content-Length` you just noted.
9. Send the request and confirm that your payload is successfully reflected in the tunnelled response. If you still encounter a timeout, you may not have added enough padding.
10. While the cache is still poisoned, visit the home page using the same cachebuster query parameter and confirm that the `alert()` fires.
11. In the Inspector, remove the cachebuster from your request and resend it until you have poisoned the cache. Keep resending the request every 5 seconds or so to keep the cache poisoned until the victim visits the home page and the lab is solved.

## Vulnerability note

Underlying issue: HTTP request smuggling (CWE-444). Use a consistent, well-configured front-end/back-end HTTP stack; reject ambiguous Transfer-Encoding/Content-Length combinations.
