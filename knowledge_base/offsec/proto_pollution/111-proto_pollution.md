# PROTO_POLLUTION — portswigger_labs_sft

- source: portswigger_labs_sft
- class: proto_pollution
- cwe: CWE-1321

## Scenario

Help me complete the lab "Client-side prototype pollution via flawed sanitization" from PortSwigger Web Security Academy. Category: Prototype pollution. Difficulty: Practitioner.

This lab is vulnerable to DOM XSS via client-side prototype pollution. Although the developers have implemented measures to prevent prototype pollution, these can be easily bypassed.

To solve the lab:

Find a source that you can use to add arbitrary properties to the global `Object.prototype`.

 Identify a gadget property that allows you to execute arbitrary JavaScript.

 Combine these to call `alert()`.

Provide the ordered solution steps.

## Analysis / Response

This PortSwigger Web Security Academy lab (Practitioner) covers Prototype pollution: "Client-side prototype pollution via flawed sanitization".

## Solution steps

1. In your browser, try polluting `Object.prototype` by injecting an arbitrary property via the query string: `/?__proto__.foo=bar`
2. Open the browser DevTools panel and go to the Console tab.
3. Enter `Object.prototype`.
4. Study the properties of the returned object and observe that your injected `foo` property has not been added.
5. Try alternative prototype pollution vectors. For example: `/?__proto__[foo]=bar /?constructor.prototype.foo=bar`
6. Observe that in each instance, `Object.prototype` is not modified.
7. Go to the Sources tab and study the JavaScript files that are loaded by the target site. Notice that `deparamSanitized.js` uses the `sanitizeKey()` function defined in `searchLoggerFiltered.js` to strip potentially dangerous property keys based on a blocklist. However, it does not apply this filter recursively.
8. Back in the URL, try injecting one of the blocked keys in such a way that the dangerous key remains following the sanitization process. For example: `/?__pro__proto__to__[foo]=bar /?__pro__proto__to__.foo=bar /?constconstructorructor[protoprototypetype][foo]=bar /?constconstructorructor.protoprototypetype.foo=bar`
9. In the console, enter `Object.prototype` again. Notice that it now has its own `foo` property with the value `bar`. You've successfully found a prototype pollution source and bypassed the website's key sanitization.

## Vulnerability note

Underlying issue: Prototype pollution (CWE-1321). Freeze prototypes where possible; avoid recursive merges of untrusted objects into Object.prototype.
